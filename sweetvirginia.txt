Wadin' through the waste stormy winter
And there's not a friend to help you through
Tryin' to stop the waves behind your eyeballs
Drop your reds, drop your greens and blues

Thank you for your wine, California
Thank you for your sweet and bitter fruits
Yes I got the desert in my toenail
And I hid the speed inside my shoe

But come on, come on down Sweet Virginia
Come on, honey child, beg you
Come on, come on down, you got it in ya
Got to scrape the shit right off your shoes

Yeah, I want you to come on, come on down Sweet Virginia

I want you to come on, come on down Sweet Virginia
I want you come on, honey child, I beg you
I want you come on, honey child you got it in you
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoes

But come on, come on down Sweet Virginia
Come on, come on down, I beg
Come on, come on down, you got it in you
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoes
