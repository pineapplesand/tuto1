[Verse]
 A
You got to move, you got to move
 D  A
You got to move child, you got to move 
A   E
Cause when the Lord get ready
 A
You got to move.

You may be white, you may be dark
You may be rich child, you may be poor
But when the Lord get ready
You got to move

You see that woman, who walks the street
You see that police, upon his beat
Gut when the Lord get ready
You got to move.

Born Under A Bad Sign - Albert King
 
 
[Chorus]
D
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
A
If it wasn't for bad luck
G
I wouldn't have no luck at all 
 
[Verse]
D
Bad luck and trouble's my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten
 
 
[Chorus] (x2)
D
I canÂ´t read, never learned how to write
My whole life is one big fight
 
 
[Solo]
 
D
Wine and women is all I crave
A big legged woman's gonna carry me to my grave
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
A
If it wasn't for bad luck
G
I wouldn't have no luck
A
If it wasn't for real bad luck
G (stop)
I wouldn't have no luck at all
